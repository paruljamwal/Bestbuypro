## End Note

In this project we tried to make the clone of the Best Buy wesite as close to real one by using all the technical skills that we have learned up until now. We tried making it using Mongodb ,  HTML, CSS, Javascripts. We have also created the backend part of this website which is use for authentication as well as storing & seaching data of the couses. The search keywords is passed to the backend inorder to get keywords related results. Workflow is not the same as original. We tried our best to clone it.
## Limitations
 
 Not all pages are responsive. Some pages are not excatly same as original website.
